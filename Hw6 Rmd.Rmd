## R Markdown
We use facet_wrap to draw line plots to represent the trend for house_price_index over years for each state.Also, 
 line graph was use to compare the change in house prices and unemployment rates across the states over time. line graph is an effective way to comprehend the changes that have occurred over the years in both home prices and unemployment rates.
